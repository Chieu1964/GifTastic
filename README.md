### Funny Animals App

1. The App started with five buttons as default, which are called: Dog, Cat, Tiger, Lion and Crocodine.

2. When you click a button, some images related to the animal associated with that button will be displayed. Under every images will be its rating (PG, G, so on).

3. When you  click on one of the still images, it will animate. To stop it from playing, just click on it again.

4. You can add any animal you like in the text box, then click the button named "Here you go!". 

### Enjoy!
